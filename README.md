# Bank-Customer-Churn-Prediction
🚀 Bank Customer Churn Prediction
📌 Project Overview
This project aims to predict customer churn in a bank using machine learning techniques. By analyzing customer credit score, account details, and transaction history, the model helps identify customers at risk of leaving, enabling proactive retention strategies.

📊 Dataset
The dataset consists of customer details such as age, credit score, tenure, balance, number of products, and more.
Target variable: Exited (1 - Customer left, 0 - Customer stayed).
🛠️ Technologies Used
Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
Scikit-Learn (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for insights
Feature Engineering to improve model performance
Hyperparameter Tuning for optimization
Model Evaluation (Accuracy Score, Precision-Recall, Confusion Matrix)

📌 Key Features
✅ Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
✅ Multiple Machine Learning Models for comparison
✅ Hyperparameter tuning for better accuracy
